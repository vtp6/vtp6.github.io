C. Canius, eques Romanus, cum se Syracusas contulisset, 
dicebat se hortulos aliquos emere velle, quo invitare amicos 
et ubi se oblectare sine interpellatoribus posset. || quod cum 
percrebuisset, Pythius quidam, qui argentariam faciebat 
Syracusis, ei dixit se hortos habere, non venales quidem sed 
quibus Canius uti posset, si vellet, ut suis: || et simul ad cenam 
hominem in hortos invitavit. || cum ille promisisset, tum 
Pythius piscatores ad se convocavit, et ab eis petivit ut ante 
suos hortulos postridie piscarentur, dixitque quid eos facere
vellet. 

When Gaius Canius, a Roman knight, went to Syracuse, he said that he wanted to buy a small estate to which he could invite friends and where he could amuse himself without intruders.
When this became widely known, a certain Pythius, who managed a bank at Syracuse, told him that he had gardens which in fact were not for sale, but which Canius could use as his own, if he wished;
and at the same time, he invited the fellow into his gardens for a meal.
When he accepted, then Pythius summoned the fishermen to him and asked them to fish in front of his small estate on the following day and told (them) what he wanted them to do.

ad cenam tempore venit Canius. || cumbarum ante
oculos multitudo; pro se quisque, quod ceperat, adferebat; ||
ante pedes Pythii pisces deiciebantur. || tum Canius 'quaeso'
inquit 'quid est hoc, Pythi? quare tot pisces, tot cumbae?' || et 
ille 'quid mirum?' inquit 'quidquid est piscium Syracusis
est in hoc loco.' || incensus Canius cupiditate contendit a
Pythio ut venderet. recusavit ille primo. || tandem tamen 
emit homo cupidus et dives tanti, quanti Pythius voluit. ||
invitat Canius postridie familiares suos; venit ipse mature; 
cumbam nullam videt. || quaerit a proximo vicino num feriae
piscatorum essent. || 'nullae, quod sciam' inquit 'sed hic 
piscari nulli solent. itaque heri mirabar quid accidisset.' || 
iratissimus Canius; sed quid faceret?

Canius came for the meal on time.
Before his eyes (there was) a large number of fishing boats; each man, according to his ability, brought what he had caught;
the fish were being thrown down before the feet of Pythius.
Then Canius said, 'I beg (you), Pythius, what is this? Why so many fish, so many boats?'
And Pythius replied, 'What's so strange (about that)? All the fish there are at Syracuse are in this area.'
Canius, inflamed by greed, begged Pythius to sell (the estate). At first he refused.
Finally, however, the greedy rich man bought it for the price which Pythius wanted.
Canius invited his close friends for the following day; he himself came early; he saw no boat.
He asked the nearest neighbour whether it was a fishermen's holiday.
'Not as far as I know' he said, 'but no one usually fishes here. So I was surprised yesterday at what had happened.'
Canius (was) very angry; but what was he to do?
