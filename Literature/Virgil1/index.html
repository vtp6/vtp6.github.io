hinc via Tartarei quae fert Acherontis ad undas.
turbidus hic caeno vastaque voragine gurges
aestuat atque omnem Cocyto eructat harenam. ||
portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat
terribili squalore Charon, cui plurima mento
canities inculta iacet, stant lumina flamma,
sordidus ex umeris nodo dependet amictus. ||
ipse ratem conto subigit velisque ministrat
et ferruginea subvectat corpora cumba,
iam senior, sed cruda deo viridisque senectus.

From here is the route which leads to the waves of the infernal Acheron. Here, a whirlpool, thick with mud and with an enormous chasm, boils up and spews forth all the sand into the Cocytus.
The dreaded ferryman, Charon, (a creature) of dreadful filth, guards these waters and rivers, on whose chin very many grey hairs lie unkempt, his eyes stare with fire and a dirty cloak hangs in a knot from his shoulders.
(Charon) himself drives the boat with a pole, attends to the sails and carries the bodies in his dusky boat; (he is) now rather old, but the god's age is fresh and vigorous.

huc omnis turba ad ripas effusa ruebat,
matres atque viri defunctaque corpora vita
magnanimum heroum, pueri innuptaeque puellae,
impositique rogis iuvenes ante ora parentum: ||
quam multa in silvis autumni frigore primo
lapsa cadunt folia, aut ad terram gurgite ab alto
quam multae glomerantur aves, ubi frigidus annus
trans pontum fugat et terris immittit apricis. ||
stabant orantes primi transmittere cursum
tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore.
navita sed tristis nunc hos nunc accipit illos,
ast alios longe summotos arcet harena.

The whole crowd spread far and wide was rushing hither to the banks, mothers and husbands, bodies of high-souled heroes who have completed their lifespan, boys and unmarried girls and men in their prime placed on funeral pyres before the faces of their parents:
as many as the leaves in the woods which, slipping down, fall in the first frost of autumn, or as many as the birds which gather together from the deep sea to the land, when the cold season makes them flee across the sea and sends (them) to sunny lands.
They stood (there), begging to be the first to go across on the passage and stretched out their hands in their desire for the further shore. But the gloomy sailor takes on board now these, now those, but others, driven away, he keeps far from the sand.

ergo iter inceptum peragunt fluvioque propinquant.
navita quos iam inde ut Stygia prospexit ab unda
per tacitum nemus ire pedemque advertere ripae,
sic prior adgreditur dictis atque increpat ultro: ||
'quisquis es, armatus qui nostra ad flumina tendis,
fare age, quid venias, iam istinc et comprime gressum.
umbrarum hic locus est, somni noctisque soporae:
corpora viva nefas Stygia vectare carina. ||
nec vero Alciden me sum laetatus euntem
accepisse lacu, nec Thesea Pirithoumque,
dis quamquam geniti atque invicti viribus essent. ||
Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit
ipsius a solio regis traxitque trementem;
hi dominam Ditis thalamo deducere adorti.'
quae contra breviter fata est Amphrysia vates:

Therefore, they completed the journey which they had begun and approached the river. When the sailor, right from where he was, from the Stygian water, caught sight of them going through the silent grove and turning their feet towards the bank, he accosted them first with his words and thus rebuked them as well:
'Whoever you are, who, armed, make your way to our rivers, come, say this instant, from there, why you are coming, and check your steps. This is the region of the shades, of sleep and drowsy night; it is a sin to carry live bodies in the Stygian boat.
Indeed, I was not happy that I accepted either Hercules going on the lake, or Theseus and Pirithous, although they were descended from gods and unconquered in strength.
The former sought forcibly (to put) the guard of the Underworld in chains and dragged him quivering from the throne of the king himself; the latter attempted to take away the wife of Pluto from her bedchamber.'  In reply to these words, the Amphrysian prophetess spoke briefly:
