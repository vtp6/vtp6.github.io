iuvenis ego Mileto profectus ad spectaculum Olympicum,
cum haec etiam loca provinciae clarae visitare cuperem,
peragrata tota Thessalia Larissam perveni. || ac dum urbem
pererrans tenuato viatico paupertati meae fomenta quaero,
medio in foro senem conspicio. || insistebat lapidem magnaque
voce praedicabat, si quis mortuum custodire vellet,
magnum pretium accepturum esse. || et cuidam
praetereunti 'quid hoc' inquam 'audio? hic mortui solent
aufugere?' ||
'tace,' respondit ille. 'nam puer et satis peregrinus es,
meritoque nescis in Thessalia te esse, ubi sagae ora
mortuorum semper demorsicant, quae sunt illis artis magicae
supplementa.'

When I was a young man, I set out from Miletus for the Olympic Games and, having travelled through the whole of Thessaly, since I also wanted to visit this area of the famous province, I reached Larissa.
And while I wandered through the city seeking remedies for my poverty, as my travelling allowance was diminished, I caught sight of an old man in the middle of the forum.
He was standing on a stone and proclaimed in a loud voice that if anyone was willing to guard a dead man, he would receive a great reward.
And I said to someone passing by, 'What's this I hear? Do dead men make a habit of running away here?'
'Be quiet,' he replied. 'For you are a boy and quite a stranger, and naturally you don't realise that you are in Thessaly, where witches are always biting pieces out of the faces of the dead, which are supplements for their magic art.

contra ego 'quali custodela' inquam 'opus est?' ||
'iam primum' respondit ille 'totam noctem eximie
vigilandum est apertis et inconivis oculis semper in cadaver
intentis, nec acies usquam devertenda est, cum illae pessimae
sagae latenter arrepant, forma in quodvis animal conversa. ||
nam et aves et canes et mures, immo vero etiam muscas,
induunt.' ||
his cognitis animum meum commasculo et statim accedens
senem 'clamare' inquam 'iam desine. adest custos paratus.' ||
vix finieram, et statim me perducit ad domum quandam,
ubi demonstrat matronam flebilem fuscis vestimentis
contectam. || illa surrexit et ad cubiculum me induxit. ibi
corpus splendentibus linteis coopertum manu revelavit.
ubi singula anxie demonstravit, exiit.

In reply, I said, 'What sort of guarding is necessary?'
He replied, 'Now first of all, you must keep exceptionally awake the whole night with your eyes open and sleepless always directed at the corpse; nor should you turn your gaze away anywhere, since those very evil witches creep up secretly, having changed their shape into any type of animal.
For they adopt the form of birds, dogs and mice, indeed, even flies.'
When I learned these things, I strengthened my resolve and, immediately approaching the old man, I said, 'Now stop shouting. A guard is at hand, prepared.'
Scarcely had I finished, and he immediately led me to a certain house, where he pointed out a weeping woman wrapped in dark garments.
She rose and led me into a bedroom. There with her hand she uncovered a body covered with shining white sheets. When she had anxiously shown the features one by one, she went out.

sic desolatus ad cadaveris solacium, perfrictis oculis et
paratis ad vigiliam, dum animum meum permulcebam
cantationibus, usque ad mediam noctem pervigilabam. ||
tum autem mihi formido cumulatior cum repente
introrepens mustela contra me constitit oculosque in me
fixit. || tanta fiducia in tantula animali mihi turbavit animum.
denique sic illi 'abi,' inquam 'scelesta bestia, antequam
meam vim celeriter experiaris! abi!' ||
mustela terga vertit et e cubiculo protinus exit. sine mora
somnus tam profundus me repente demergit, ut ne deus
quidem Delphicus ipse facile discernere posset ex duobus
nobis iacentibus, quis esset magis mortuus. ||
tandem prima luce expergitus et magno pavore
perterritus cadaver accurro, et admoto lumine revelatoque
eius vultu, omnia diligenter inspicio: nihil deest. || ecce uxor
misera flens introrumpit: cadavere inspecto reddit sine
mora praemium.

Left alone thus to console the corpse, I rubbed my eyes and prepared them for my sleepless watch. While I calmed down my mind down with songs, I stayed awake until midnight.
Then, however, my fear became more intensified when suddenly a weasel creeping in stopped opposite me and fixed its eyes upon me.
Such great confidence in so small an animal disturbed my mind. Finally, I spoke to it as follows, 'Go away, wicked beast, before you quickly experience my force! Go away!'
The weasel retreated and went from the bedroom immediately. Without delay, such a deep sleep suddenly overwhelmed me, that not even the Delphic god himself could easily have distinguished out of the two of us lying (there) who was the more dead.
At last awakened at dawn and terrified by great fear, I ran up to the corpse and having moved a lamp near it and uncovered its face, I examined everything carefully: nothing was missing.
Behold, the wretched wife, weeping, burst in. Having examined the corpse, she gave me the reward without delay.

'per fidem vestram' inquit 'cives, per pietatem publicam,
perempto civi subsistite et extremum facinus istius feminae
nefariae scelestaeque severiter vindicate. || haec enim nec
ullus alius miserum iuvenem, sororis meae filium, in adulteri
gratiam et ob praedam hereditariam exstinxit veneno.' ||
illa, lacrimis effusis quamque sanctissime poterat
adiurans cunctos deos, tantum scelus abnuebat. || ergo senex
ille: 'veritatis arbitrium in divinam providentiam ponamus. ||
Zatchlas adest Aegyptius propheta notissimus, qui mihi
promisit se pro magno praemio spiritum istius cadaveris
paulisper ab inferis reducturum esse corpusque
animaturum.'

'By your good faith, citizens,' he said, 'by your public sense of duty, help a murdered citizen and avenge with severity the vilest crime of that impious and wicked woman.
For this woman, and no other, by means of poison destroyed a poor young man, my sister's son, to win the favour of her adulterous lover and for the sake of inherited profit.'
That woman, pouring forth tears and swearing by all the gods as solemnly as she could, denied so great a crime.
Therefore, that old man said, 'Let us put the judgement of the truth into the hands of divine providence.
Zatchlas is here, a very well-known Egyptian prophet, who, in return for a great reward, has promised me that he will bring back the spirit of that poor corpse from the dead for a short time and bring his body back to life.'

immitto me turbae et pone ipsum lectulum lapidem insistens
omnia curiosis oculis spectabam. || iam tumore pectus
cadaveris extolli, iam spiritu corpus impleri. || et surgit
cadaver et profatur: 'cur, oro, me post Lethaea pocula iam
Stygiis paludibus innatantem ad momentariae vitae officia
reducitis? desine iam, precor, desine, ac me in meam quietem
permitte.' ||
haec vox de corpore audita est, sed propheta aliquanto
commotior 'quin narras' inquit 'populo omnia de morte
tua?' ||
respondet ille de lectulo et imo cum gemitu populum sic
adloquitur: 'malis novae nuptae artibus peremptus et
addictus noxio poculo, torum tepentem adultero reddidi. ||
dabo vobis documenta veritatis perlucida, et quod prorsus
alius nemo cognoverit vel ominaverit indicabo.'

I pushed myself into the crowd and, standing on a stone behind the bier itself, watched everything with curious eyes.
Now the corpse's breast began to raise itself with swelling, now the body was filled with the breath of life.
The corpse rose up and spoke out: 'I beg you, why do you restore me to the functions of a fleeting life when I was already floating on the Stygian marshes after drinking the waters of Lethe? Stop now, stop, I pray, and let me go to my rest.'
This utterance was heard from the corpse, but the prophet, considerably more excited, said 'Why don't you relate all the details about your death to the people?'
He replied from the bier and with a deep groan addressed the people as follows: 'Destroyed by the evil arts of my new bride and sentenced (to death) by the poisoned cup, I gave up the (still) warm bed to the adulterer.
I will give you very clear proofs of the truth, and reveal what absolutely no one else has discovered or predicted.'

tunc digito me demonstrans: 'nam cum corporis mei
custos hic sagacissimus exsertam vigiliam mihi teneret,
sagae quaedam exuviis meis imminentes forma mutata
apparuerunt. || cum industriam sedulam eius fallere non
potuissent, postremo iniecta somni nebula eum in
profundam quietem sepeliverunt. || tum me nomine excitare
coeperunt neque prius desierunt quam dum hebetes
artus mei et membra frigida ad artis magicae obsequia
segniter nituntur. || hic autem, qui vivus erat, et tantum
sopore mortuus, idem mecum nomen forte habet.
ad suum nomen igitur ignarus exsurgit, et, in exanimis
umbrae modum ultro gradiens, ianuam adit.

Then pointing to me with his finger, he said, 'For when this very shrewd guardian of my body was keeping his extensive watch over me, some witches standing threateningly over my remains appeared in changed form.
When they could not deceive his unremitting diligence, they finally cast a cloud of sleep upon him and buried him in deep slumber.
Then they began to rouse me by name and did not stop until my sluggish joints and cold limbs slowly struggled to obey their magic art.
Now this man, who was alive and only dead in sleep, by chance has the same name as I. Therefore, at the sound of his name he unknowingly rose up, and, walking mechanically like a lifeless ghost, he approached the door.

'quamquam
fores cubiculi diligenter occlusae erant, per quoddam
foramen prosectis naso prius ac mox auribus lanienam pro
me passus est. || tum sagae ceram in modum prosectarum
formatam aurium ei applicant nasumque similem prosecto
comparant. et nunc stat miser hic, praemium non industriae
sed lanienae consecutus.' ||

nasum prehendo: sequitur; aures pertracto: deruunt. || ac

capillis hinc inde deiectis aurium vulnera celavi, nasi vero
dedecus linteolo isto decenter obtexi.

'Although the folding doors of the bedroom had been carefully locked, (the witches), through some hole or other, first cut off his nose, and shortly afterwards his ears, and he suffered butchery instead of me.
Then the witches attached to him wax shaped like the ears which had been cut off, and fitted on a nose similar to the one cut off. And now the poor man stands here, having obtained not the reward of his diligence, but the reward of butchery.'
Frightened by these words, I began to examine my appearance. I grasped my nose with my hand: it came off; I felt my ears: they fell off.
And while the crowd pointed me out with their fingers and nods directed (at me), dripping with cold sweat, I escaped between the feet of the bystanders.
Nor could I have returned to my native land thereafter, so maimed and so ridiculous, but with my hair let down on both sides, I concealed the wounds to my ears, but I covered the shame of my nose decently with this pathetic linen patch.

C. Canius, eques Romanus, cum se Syracusas contulisset,
dicebat se hortulos aliquos emere velle, quo invitare amicos
et ubi se oblectare sine interpellatoribus posset. || quod cum
percrebuisset, Pythius quidam, qui argentariam faciebat
Syracusis, ei dixit se hortos habere, non venales quidem sed
quibus Canius uti posset, si vellet, ut suis: || et simul ad cenam
hominem in hortos invitavit. || cum ille promisisset, tum
Pythius piscatores ad se convocavit, et ab eis petivit ut ante
suos hortulos postridie piscarentur, dixitque quid eos facere
vellet.

When Gaius Canius, a Roman knight, went to Syracuse, he said that he wanted to buy a small estate to which he could invite friends and where he could amuse himself without intruders.
When this became widely known, a certain Pythius, who managed a bank at Syracuse, told him that he had gardens which in fact were not for sale, but which Canius could use as his own, if he wished;
and at the same time, he invited the fellow into his gardens for a meal.
When he accepted, then Pythius summoned the fishermen to him and asked them to fish in front of his small estate on the following day and told (them) what he wanted them to do.

ad cenam tempore venit Canius. cumbarum ante
oculos multitudo; pro se quisque, quod ceperat, adferebat; ||
ante pedes Pythii pisces deiciebantur. tum Canius 'quaeso'
inquit 'quid est hoc, Pythi? quare tot pisces, tot cumbae?' || et
ille 'quid mirum?' inquit 'quidquid est piscium Syracusis
est in hoc loco.' || incensus Canius cupiditate contendit a
Pythio ut venderet. recusavit ille primo. tandem tamen
emit homo cupidus et dives tanti, quanti Pythius voluit. ||
invitat Canius postridie familiares suos; venit ipse mature;
cumbam nullam videt. || quaerit a proximo vicino num feriae
piscatorum essent. 'nullae, quod sciam' inquit 'sed hic
piscari nulli solent. itaque heri mirabar quid accidisset.' ||
iratissimus Canius; sed quid faceret?

Canius came for the meal on time. Before his eyes (there was) a large number of fishing boats; each man, according to his ability, brought what he had caught;
the fish were being thrown down before the feet of Pythius. Then Canius said, 'I beg (you), Pythius, what is this? Why so many fish, so many boats?'
And Pythius replied, 'What's so strange (about that)? All the fish there are at Syracuse are in this area.'
Canius, inflamed by greed, begged Pythius to sell (the estate). At first he refused. Finally, however, the greedy rich man bought it for the price which Pythius wanted.
Canius invited his close friends for the following day; he himself came early; he saw no boat.
He asked the nearest neighbour whether it was a fishermen's holiday. 'Not as far as I know' he said, 'but no one usually fishes here. So I was surprised yesterday at what had happened.'
Canius (was) very angry; but what was he to do?
