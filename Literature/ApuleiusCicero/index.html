iuvenis ego Mileto profectus ad spectaculum Olympicum, 
cum haec etiam loca provinciae clarae visitare cuperem, 
peragrata tota Thessalia Larissam perveni. || ac dum urbem 
pererrans tenuato viatico paupertati meae fomenta quaero, 
medio in foro senem conspicio. || insistebat lapidem magnaque 
voce praedicabat, si quis mortuum custodire vellet, 
magnum pretium accepturum esse. || et cuidam 
praetereunti 'quid hoc' inquam 'audio? hic mortui solent 
aufugere?' ||
'tace,' respondit ille. 'nam puer et satis peregrinus es, 
meritoque nescis in Thessalia te esse, ubi sagae ora 
mortuorum semper demorsicant, quae sunt illis artis magicae 
supplementa.'

When I was a young man, I set out from Miletus for the Olympic Games and, having travelled through the whole of Thessaly, since I also wanted to visit this area of the famous province, I reached Larissa.
And while I wandered through the city seeking remedies for my poverty, as my travelling allowance was diminished, I caught sight of an old man in the middle of the forum.
He was standing on a stone and proclaimed in a loud voice that if anyone was willing to guard a dead man, he would receive a great reward.
And I said to someone passing by, 'What's this I hear? Do dead men make a habit of running away here?'
'Be quiet,' he replied. 'For you are a boy and quite a stranger, and naturally you don't realise that you are in Thessaly, where witches are always biting pieces out of the faces of the dead, which are supplements for their magic art.

contra ego 'quali custodela' inquam 'opus est?' ||
'iam primum' respondit ille 'totam noctem eximie
vigilandum est apertis et inconivis oculis semper in cadaver
intentis, nec acies usquam devertenda est, cum illae pessimae
sagae latenter arrepant, forma in quodvis animal conversa. ||
nam et aves et canes et mures, immo vero etiam muscas,
induunt.' ||
his cognitis animum meum commasculo et statim accedens
senem 'clamare' inquam 'iam desine. adest custos paratus.' ||
vix finieram, et statim me perducit ad domum quandam, 
ubi demonstrat matronam flebilem fuscis vestimentis
contectam. || illa surrexit et ad cubiculum me induxit. ibi
corpus splendentibus linteis coopertum manu revelavit. 
ubi singula anxie demonstravit, exiit. 

In reply, I said, 'What sort of guarding is necessary?'
He replied, 'Now first of all, you must keep exceptionally awake the whole night with your eyes open and sleepless always directed at the corpse; nor should you turn your gaze away anywhere, since those very evil witches creep up secretly, having changed their shape into any type of animal.
For they adopt the form of birds, dogs and mice, indeed, even flies.'
When I learned these things, I strengthened my resolve and, immediately approaching the old man, I said, 'Now stop shouting. A guard is at hand, prepared.'
Scarcely had I finished, and he immediately led me to a certain house, where he pointed out a weeping woman wrapped in dark garments.
She rose and led me into a bedroom. There with her hand she uncovered a body covered with shining white sheets. When she had anxiously shown the features one by one, she went out.

sic desolatus ad cadaveris solacium, perfrictis oculis et 
paratis ad vigiliam, dum animum meum permulcebam
cantationibus, usque ad mediam noctem pervigilabam. ||
tum autem mihi formido cumulatior cum repente 
introrepens mustela contra me constitit oculosque in me 
fixit. || tanta fiducia in tantula animali mihi turbavit animum. 
denique sic illi 'abi,' inquam 'scelesta bestia, antequam 
meam vim celeriter experiaris! abi!' ||
mustela terga vertit et e cubiculo protinus exit. sine mora 
somnus tam profundus me repente demergit, ut ne deus 
quidem Delphicus ipse facile discernere posset ex duobus 
nobis iacentibus, quis esset magis mortuus. ||
tandem prima luce expergitus et magno pavore 
perterritus cadaver accurro, et admoto lumine revelatoque 
eius vultu, omnia diligenter inspicio: nihil deest. || ecce uxor 
misera flens introrumpit: cadavere inspecto reddit sine 
mora praemium.

Left alone thus to console the corpse, I rubbed my eyes and prepared them for my sleepless watch. While I calmed down my mind down with songs, I stayed awake until midnight.
Then, however, my fear became more intensified when suddenly a weasel creeping in stopped opposite me and fixed its eyes upon me.
Such great confidence in so small an animal disturbed my mind. Finally, I spoke to it as follows, 'Go away, wicked beast, before you quickly experience my force! Go away!'
The weasel retreated and went from the bedroom immediately. Without delay, such a deep sleep suddenly overwhelmed me, that not even the Delphic god himself could easily have distinguished out of the two of us lying (there) who was the more dead.
At last awakened at dawn and terrified by great fear, I ran up to the corpse and having moved a lamp near it and uncovered its face, I examined everything carefully: nothing was missing.
Behold, the wretched wife, weeping, burst in. Having examined the corpse, she gave me the reward without delay.

'per fidem vestram' inquit 'cives, per pietatem publicam, 
perempto civi subsistite et extremum facinus istius feminae 
nefariae scelestaeque severiter vindicate. || haec enim nec 
ullus alius miserum iuvenem, sororis meae filium, in adulteri 
gratiam et ob praedam hereditariam exstinxit veneno.' ||
illa, lacrimis effusis quamque sanctissime poterat 
adiurans cunctos deos, tantum scelus abnuebat. || ergo senex 
ille: 'veritatis arbitrium in divinam providentiam ponamus. ||
Zatchlas adest Aegyptius propheta notissimus, qui mihi 
promisit se pro magno praemio spiritum istius cadaveris 
paulisper ab inferis reducturum esse corpusque
animaturum.' 

'By your good faith, citizens,' he said, 'by your public sense of duty, help a murdered citizen and avenge with severity the vilest crime of that impious and wicked woman.
For this woman, and no other, by means of poison destroyed a poor young man, my sister's son, to win the favour of her adulterous lover and for the sake of inherited profit.' 
That woman, pouring forth tears and swearing by all the gods as solemnly as she could, denied so great a crime.
Therefore, that old man said, 'Let us put the judgement of the truth into the hands of divine providence.
Zatchlas is here, a very well-known Egyptian prophet, who, in return for a great reward, has promised me that he will bring back the spirit of that poor corpse from the dead for a short time and bring his body back to life.'

C. Canius, eques Romanus, cum se Syracusas contulisset, 
dicebat se hortulos aliquos emere velle, quo invitare amicos 
et ubi se oblectare sine interpellatoribus posset. || quod cum 
percrebuisset, Pythius quidam, qui argentariam faciebat 
Syracusis, ei dixit se hortos habere, non venales quidem sed 
quibus Canius uti posset, si vellet, ut suis: || et simul ad cenam 
hominem in hortos invitavit. || cum ille promisisset, tum 
Pythius piscatores ad se convocavit, et ab eis petivit ut ante 
suos hortulos postridie piscarentur, dixitque quid eos facere
vellet. 

When Gaius Canius, a Roman knight, went to Syracuse, he said that he wanted to buy a small estate to which he could invite friends and where he could amuse himself without intruders.
When this became widely known, a certain Pythius, who managed a bank at Syracuse, told him that he had gardens which in fact were not for sale, but which Canius could use as his own, if he wished;
and at the same time, he invited the fellow into his gardens for a meal.
When he accepted, then Pythius summoned the fishermen to him and asked them to fish in front of his small estate on the following day and told (them) what he wanted them to do.

Cicero Page 2

ad cenam tempore venit Canius. cumbarum ante
oculos multitudo; pro se quisque, quod ceperat, adferebat; ||
ante pedes Pythii pisces deiciebantur. tum Canius 'quaeso'
inquit 'quid est hoc, Pythi? quare tot pisces, tot cumbae?' || et 
ille 'quid mirum?' inquit 'quidquid est piscium Syracusis
est in hoc loco.' || incensus Canius cupiditate contendit a
Pythio ut venderet. recusavit ille primo. tandem tamen 
emit homo cupidus et dives tanti, quanti Pythius voluit. ||
invitat Canius postridie familiares suos; venit ipse mature; 
cumbam nullam videt. || quaerit a proximo vicino num feriae
piscatorum essent. 'nullae, quod sciam' inquit 'sed hic 
piscari nulli solent. itaque heri mirabar quid accidisset.' || 
iratissimus Canius; sed quid faceret?

Canius came for the meal on time. Before his eyes (there was) a large number of fishing boats; each man, according to his ability, brought what he had caught;
the fish were being thrown down before the feet of Pythius. Then Canius said, 'I beg (you), Pythius, what is this? Why so many fish, so many boats?'
And Pythius replied, 'What's so strange (about that)? All the fish there are at Syracuse are in this area.'
Canius, inflamed by greed, begged Pythius to sell (the estate). At first he refused. Finally, however, the greedy rich man bought it for the price which Pythius wanted.
Canius invited his close friends for the following day; he himself came early; he saw no boat.
He asked the nearest neighbour whether it was a fishermen's holiday. 'Not as far as I know' he said, 'but no one usually fishes here. So I was surprised yesterday at what had happened.'
Canius (was) very angry; but what was he to do?
