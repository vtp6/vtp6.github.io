                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Vocabulary Testing Program 6 (VTP6) is an <strong>online successor to the app-based VTP5 program
                    </strong>. It provides languages students with <strong>a better way to learn vocabulary</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Because it is online, VTP6 <strong>can be accessed from mobile phones</strong>, while VTP5 cannot.
                    Also, VTP6 has <strong>many more features</strong> than VTP5, including Match and Quick Fire modes. 
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 is also <strong>much better than competitors such as Quizlet</strong>, because it <strong>
                    forces you to do active revision</strong>, while flashcards are passive. 
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Furthermore, VTP6 <strong>will always be completely free for everyone</strong>, and there are
                    <strong>no ads</strong> on the site either (Quizlet runs ads, and some features are locked behind a
                    paywall).
                </p>

            <section id="how-to-use">
                <h1 class="faq-question">How do I use VTP6?</h1>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    First, <strong>navigate to <a href="https://vtp6.rujulnayak.com/folders/">the Folders homepage</a>
                    </strong>. Then, <strong>select your language</strong> from the options there (Latin, Spanish,
                    French, German), and then <strong>choose your folder</strong> (e.g. GCSE).
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    From there, you can <strong>select which units/chapters</strong> of the folder you want to study
                    using the checkboxes. Then, <strong>choose your game mode</strong> (see below) and <strong>press
                    start</strong>, then watch your grades shoot upwards!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="game-mode">
                <h1 class="faq-question">Which game modes are on VTP6?</h1>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Classic Mode</h3>
                <!-- TODO: gifs of game modes-->
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Classic Mode is the most basic game mode on VTP6. A <strong>random term</strong> from your chosen
                    sets will come up, and you have to <strong>type the definition</strong> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    You can keep playing <strong>until the selected terms run out</strong>, or you can finish the game
                    early using the finish button. At the end, you can <strong>retry your mistakes</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 is supported by a <strong>superior typo detection algorithm</strong> which can prompt you to
                    retry a question if it thinks you made a typo. Furthermore, the algorithm <strong>ignores case and
                    punctuation</strong> to make it easier for mobile users (where the first letter is usually
                    auto-capitalised).
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Classic Infinite Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Classic Infinite Mode is an extension of Classic Mode where the <strong>terms keep reshuffling
                    forever</strong>. To exit, you can <strong>press the finish button</strong> and you can see your
                    mistakes in a table, just like with Classic Mode.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Match Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    The aim of Match Mode is to <strong>pair up the six terms</strong> on the left <strong>with the six
                    definitions</strong> on the right as quickly as possible. <strong>Click a term</strong> on the left
                    <strong>and then its definition</strong> on the right to pair them up. The <strong>timer at the top
                    </strong> shows you how long you have spent.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Each <strong>wrong match adds 1 second</strong> to your time. At the end, you can <strong>share your
                    score</strong> with friends. The site will keep track of your <strong>overall best score</strong> on
                    Match Mode using cookies.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Quick Fire Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    In Quick Fire Mode, you race against the clock to <strong>answer as many questions as
                    possible</strong> in the time that you are given. Each correct answer gives you <strong>some extra
                    time</strong> on the clock.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Just like Match Mode, the site will keep track of your <strong>overall highest score</strong> on
                    Quick Fire Mode using cookies.
                </p>

            <section id="cookies">
                <h1 class="faq-question">How does VTP6 use cookies?</h1>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 stores a maximum of <strong>four cookies</strong> on your browser to improve your experience on
                    this site. All cookies are stored for <strong>up to a year</strong> and then deleted.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Firstly, <code>cookiesAllowed</code> is set to <code>1</code> when you have clicked "OK" on the
                    cookies banner, which tells us that we don't have to show you the banner again.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Next, <code>vtp6Theme</code> is set to either <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code>, which tells
                    us which theme to use when you next visit the site.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Finally, <code>vtp6HighScore_match</code> and <code>vtp6HighScore_quick_fire</code> store your
                    overall high scores on the site in those game modes.
                </p>
