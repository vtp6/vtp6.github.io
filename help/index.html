                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Vocabulary Testing Program 6 (VTP6) is an <strong>online successor to the app-based VTP5 program
                    </strong>. It provides languages students with <strong>a better way to learn vocabulary</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Because it is online, VTP6 <strong>can be accessed from mobile phones</strong>, while VTP5 cannot.
                    Also, VTP6 has <strong>many more features</strong> than VTP5, including Match and Quick Fire modes. 
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 is also <strong>much better than competitors such as Quizlet</strong>, because it <strong>
                    forces you to do active revision</strong>, while flashcards are passive. 
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Furthermore, VTP6 <strong>will always be completely free for everyone</strong>, and there are
                    <strong>no ads</strong> on the site either (Quizlet runs ads, and some features are locked behind a
                    paywall).
                </p>

            <section id="how-to-use">
                <h1 class="faq-question">How do I use VTP6?</h1>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    First, <strong>navigate to <a href="https://vtp6.rujulnayak.com/folders/">the Folders homepage</a>
                    </strong>. Then, <strong>select your language</strong> from the options there (Latin, Spanish,
                    French, German), and then <strong>choose your folder</strong> (e.g. GCSE).
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    From there, you can <strong>select which units/chapters</strong> of the folder you want to study
                    using the checkboxes. Then, <strong>choose your game mode</strong> (see below) and <strong>press
                    start</strong>, then watch your grades shoot upwards!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="game-mode">
                <h1 class="faq-question">Which game modes are on VTP6?</h1>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Classic Mode</h3>
                <!-- TODO: gifs of game modes-->
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Classic Mode is the most basic game mode on VTP6. A <strong>random term</strong> from your chosen
                    sets will come up, and you have to <strong>type the definition</strong> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    You can keep playing <strong>until the selected terms run out</strong>, or you can finish the game
                    early using the finish button. At the end, you can <strong>retry your mistakes</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 is supported by a <strong>superior typo detection algorithm</strong> which can prompt you to
                    retry a question if it thinks you made a typo. Furthermore, the algorithm <strong>ignores case and
                    punctuation</strong> to make it easier for mobile users (where the first letter is usually
                    auto-capitalised).
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Classic Infinite Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Classic Infinite Mode is an extension of Classic Mode where the <strong>terms keep reshuffling
                    forever</strong>. To exit, you can <strong>press the finish button</strong> and you can see your
                    mistakes in a table, just like with Classic Mode.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Match Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    The aim of Match Mode is to <strong>pair up the six terms</strong> on the left <strong>with the six
                    definitions</strong> on the right as quickly as possible. <strong>Click a term</strong> on the left
                    <strong>and then its definition</strong> on the right to pair them up. The <strong>timer at the top
                    </strong> shows you how long you have spent.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Each <strong>wrong match adds 1 second</strong> to your time. At the end, you can <strong>share your
                    score</strong> with friends. The site will keep track of your <strong>overall best score</strong> on
                    Match Mode using local storage in your browser.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">Quick Fire Mode</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    In Quick Fire Mode, you race against the clock to <strong>answer as many questions as
                    possible</strong> in the time that you are given. Each correct answer gives you <strong>some extra
                    time</strong> on the clock.
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Just like Match Mode, the site will keep track of your <strong>overall highest score</strong> on
                    Quick Fire Mode using local storage in your browser.
                </p>

            <section id="file-formats">
                <h1 class="faq-answer">Custom Set File Formats</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    There are <strong>three options</strong> for the types of files you can upload as a custom set:
                </p>
                <h3 class="faq-header">VTP5 Format</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 is <strong>backwards-compatible with VTP5 files</strong>, which are in the following format:
                </p>
                <pre><code>Term 1
Definition 1
Term 2
Definition 2
Term 3
Definition 3</code></pre>
                <h3 class="faq-header">VTP6 Format</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    VTP6 also has <strong>its own format</strong> for text files, <strong>using tab characters</strong>
                    to separate the terms and definitions:
                </p>
                <pre><code>Term 1&Tab;Definition 1
Term 2&Tab;Definition 2
Term 3&Tab;Definition 3</code></pre>
                <h3 class="faq-header">CSV Format</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    You can also use <strong>Comma Separated Value (CSV)</strong> files. Note that if a <strong>term or
                    definition contains a comma</strong>, you should <strong>put quotes around it</strong>.
                </p>
                <pre><code>Term 1,Definition 1
Term 2,Definition 2
Term 3,Definition 3</code></pre>
